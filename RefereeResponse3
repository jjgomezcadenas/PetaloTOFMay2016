Dear editor,

We have addressed the remaining comments ad suggestions as explained in the following:

Referee 1
- Liquid xenon circulates through external getters, which reduce the impurities (in particular water) to a negligible level for light propagation. This why we consider that Rayleigh scattering is the only relevant source of attenuation of light.
- corrected as suggested.
- corrected as suggested.
- corrected as suggested.
- corrected as suggested.
- corrected as suggested.
- The referee is right, LOR should be the centre of the geometrical system. We have corrected it through all the text and in the figure.
- We have corrected to geant4.10.1.p01
- corrected as suggested.
- The referee is right, this is a typo. We have corrected 11.2 ps to 26.3 ps (which is the FWHM). Figure 7 is correct: it shows a sigma of about 11 ps, which translates to ~ 26 ps FWHM. We have changed it also in the following paragraph (" ... The CRT for PDE=1 is ~ 11 ps...")
- Yes, we fluctuated the spatial resolution with a 2 mm sigma, which means 4.7 mm FWHM.
- corrected as suggested.
- corrected as suggested.
- corrected as suggested.
- We have added the curve for VUV, as suggested.

Editor
We have corrected the inconsistency between FWHM and sigma pointed out.
We have also rephrased the last sentence of section 3.1 adding the word "average".
Indeed the centre fo the LOR is the centre of the geometrical setup, and we have corrected it all over the text.
We have redonde the plots with clearer legends.
We have corrected Ref. 5 as suggested. Ref 12 is actually spelled as "SPM"in the document ( see http://www.sensl.com/downloads/ds/TN%20-%20Intro%20to%20SPM%20Tech.pdf). We have also corrected Ref 34, thanking for pointing it out (we got confused with Chinese name and surname)!
